# Angular Module Federation
This repo demonstrates Webpack's Module Federation with Angular 12.  It specifically demonstrates:
* Dynamically loading a child Angular application running on a different server based on a route.
* Dynamically loading a component running on a different server.  As well as dynamically adding the component to the page.

## Get started
```
./install.sh
npm run start:all
```

## Up and running
Now you may navigate to the container app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
